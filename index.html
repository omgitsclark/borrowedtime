    <p class="text_column">Recent Review: This place is phenomenal. I am pretty picky when it comes to finding tattoo shops because I know that a lot of people are scammers around here, and it's happened to me before. Let me start off by saying the people that work here are amazing, friendly, and it almost feels like a second home when you walk in. Tomb raider was my tattooist for my piece, and it was a dedication to my mom. She made sure that it looked the way I had wanted it to and even changed something to make all the wording fit on the banner. I commend them for being so attentive to detail, and at a very affordable price. You really cannot beat that anywhere else. Again I'm really picky, so all the places in McKinney that I looked through did not meet my standards. If you are looking for very small intricate details I would suggest tomb raiders work because she is very good at attention to detail. The rest of the crew here are also very talented in their work and based on all the reviews I see here I can also completely recommend and agree to come here before anywhere else. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Five stars back and front !! -Google Reviewer 4/21/2022</p>
    <p class="text_column">Recent Review: We showed up as a walk in and thankfully they were able to get us in. Chris created a beautiful watercolor for me. Cam did a fantastic job on my husband's Greek lettering. Everyone in the shop was friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend! -Google Reviewer 4/28/2022

      <h3>ABOUT US:</h3>
      <img src="images/Friends-Forever.jpg" alt="" width="6000" height="4000" class="cards"/>
      <p>Graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and currently holding a job as a software developer. Growing up I was either playing games, helping fix the family cars, or shooting things in the back yard. Pretty much, if i saw a video of something cool, I made it my mission to try it out. This inevitably sparked the stupid amount of hobbies that I struggle to keep up with to this day.<br>
      On a more personal note, I married my highschool sweetheart (who I met outside a Fry's Electronics store on Black Friday) in 2018. We have three dogs (Benny, Barry, and Betty)  and are traveling as much as we can. Every day I'm thankful for the amount of crazy hobbies (and the messes those hobbies spawn) she puts up with 24/7.</p>
