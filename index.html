    <p class="text_column">During my Sophomore year in High School, there was a scourge of teenagers getting famous making rap songs and throwing them on the internet. This goes without saying, I did what any sane person would do. I took the foam padding from my bed, nailed it to the wall of the closet, stuck a microphone in there, found an instrumental beat online, got a good friend to be featured in the song and started recording. We got about…. 77 views (70 of which were ones where we sat people down and forced them to watch for critique).</p>
    <p class="text_column">Sadly though, we didn’t get the sort of attention we wanted. So the next obvious move was to double down. Download another sick instrumental beat and grab 2 more people to be featured in the song and make it longer. It was clearly the length that was the issue the first time. We managed to grab almost 100 views! This time only about 80 of those views were us.
</p>
    <p class="text_column">Fast forward to 2017, I’m sitting at home going down the YouTube black hole and I finally get to a video that made me think “This is so freaking dumb.”. 
It reminded me of those terrible videos my friends and I made back in the day which gave me a good laugh. Thus, the CloudHopR Channel was reborn. (The other channel was immediately deleted and all forms of content were thrown into the sun).

      <p>Currently stuck at home due to the current situation. This has given me a lot of time to 3d print ALL THE THINGS. I enjoy making functional things so my first project is to organize the absolute mess that is my office.<br>
        I'm also going to pour a bit of time into filling out the rest of this site. Hopefully the blogs to come will be entertaining and informational!

      <h3>ABOUT ME:</h3>
      <img src="images/About_Me.JPG" alt="" width="6000" height="4000" class="cards"/>
      <p>Graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and currently holding a job as a software developer. Growing up I was either playing games, helping fix the family cars, or shooting things in the back yard. Pretty much, if i saw a video of something cool, I made it my mission to try it out. This inevitably sparked the stupid amount of hobbies that I struggle to keep up with to this day.<br>
      On a more personal note, I married my highschool sweetheart (who I met outside a Fry's Electronics store on Black Friday) in 2018. We have three dogs (Benny, Barry, and Betty)  and are traveling as much as we can. Every day I'm thankful for the amount of crazy hobbies (and the messes those hobbies spawn) she puts up with 24/7.</p>
